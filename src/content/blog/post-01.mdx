Led by "Standing Next to You," the album carries 10 other songs, including his
hit individual singles, "Seven (feat. Latto)" and "3D (feat. Jack Harlow)" as
well as "Closer to You (feat. Major Lazer)" and "Yes or No (feat. Shawn
Mendes)." In the album, Jungkook arranged the emotional journey of a changing
relationship meticulously, starting with upbeat songs that evoke the feelings of
someone in love. It then transits to tracks with a melancholic atmosphere
portraying the emotions associated with a breakup in the latter part, according
to the agency. For this, the BTS vocalist collaborated with various global
artists, such as British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, Canadian
singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes and electronic hip-hop group Major Lazer, as well
as BloodPop, David Stewart and Blake Slatkin. Latto, Jack Harlow and DJ Snake
also participated as featured artists.
