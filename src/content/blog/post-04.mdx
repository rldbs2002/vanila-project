The biggest boy band in the world is joining the military. Members of K-pop phenomenon BTS will be enlisting in the South Korean military through a policy known as conscription, which requires all able-bodied men to serve at least 18 months. The impact of BTSâ€™s military service is likely to have economic consequences, as data suggest BTS is generating an estimated $3.9 billion in economic value per year towards the South Korean economy.

Jin gazed into the camera while taking a selfie, giving fans a closer view of his face. Another photo showed him making the victory sign. The BTS ARMY was moved to tears by Jin's statement and photos. A fan tweeted, "Even though he must be soo tired but still took permission from there & came to update us about himself & telling us to be happy & be well. I'm crying. I love you so much Jin." "Jin is proud of all the armys who waited until he posts. Let's continue waiting and not spreading pics that are not posted by Jin," read a comment. "All I'm doing right now is staring at these pictures and crying." "I missed him God I missed him so much. I hope you're staying warm and healthy," said another fan. Right after the "Astronaut" singer's images went viral on social media, some videos of his reported completion ceremony surfaced on the internet. "Kim Seokjin at the Completion Ceremony today. WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU COMMANDER TRAINEE JIN!!!", a fan's tweet read.
