NewJeans will be the first K-pop girl group to perform at the Billboard Music Awards, a major music awards ceremony in the US. The Billboard Music Awards announced on its official social media accounts Wednesday that NewJeans had been selected as one of this year’s performers.
NewJeans plans to perform “OMG” and “Super Shy,” which hit Billboard’s Hot 100 main song chart this year.
Prior to this, BTS was the only K-pop group to perform at the Billboard Music Awards, which is regarded as one of the US’ most important pop music awards shows along with the Grammy Awards and the American Music Awards NewJeans has had a strong showing on Billboard charts this year. The group’s second EP “Get Up,” which was released in July, became the fastest album of any released by a K-pop group to reach the top of the Billboard 200, the music magazine’s main album chart.

The girl group has also managed to land five songs — “OMG,” “Ditto,” “Super Shy,” “ETA,” and “Cool With You” — on the Hot 100. Three of its songs have made it onto the top 10 on the Global 200 chart, which monitors plays and sales in around 200 countries and regions around the world, while four of its songs have made it into the top 10 on the Global Excl. US.
It’s this track record that’s won NewJeans nominations in four categories: Top Billboard Global (Excl. US) Artist, Top Global K-pop Artist, Top K-pop Album, and Top Global K-pop Song — the final for which it has two songs up for an award. This makes NewJeans the most-nominated K-pop artist to date.
The awards ceremony will take place on Nov. 19 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, US.
