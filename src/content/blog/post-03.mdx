Today we are announcing Overwatch 2's first-ever in-game musical artist collaboration. We’re teaming up with K-pop sensation, LE SSERAFIM. One of the fastest growing K-pop groups on the planet, this fearless group of five (KIM CHAEWON, SAKURA, HUH YUNJIN, KAZUHA, and HONG EUNCHAE) bring their talents to Overwatch 2 this season, with the music video for LE SSERAFIM's new single, Perfect Night, which will debut Thursday, October 26 at 9 pm PDT.
This collab also will feature a LE SSERAFIM-inspired game mode and exclusive in-game items, including Legendary hero skins. Details will be revealed on Monday, October 30, with content going live in-game on November 1. LE SSERAFIM will also make an appearance at BlizzCon on November 4 for a special performance, including their new single, Perfect Night, in the BlizzCon Arena following the conclusion of the Community Night. Tickets are available at the BlizzCon official site.

Blizzard is keeping much of the details of Overwatch 2’s next collab under
wraps, but teased a “Le Sserafim-inspired custom game mode and exclusive in-game
items including Overwatch hero skins.” The developer said it will reveal more
about the collab on Oct. 30, and it will go live in-game on Nov. 1. Ahead of
that, Le Sserafim is incorporating Overwatch 2 elements into its next music
video for the single “Perfect Night,” which it started teasing on Tuesday. In
one of the teaser clips, the group is shown wearing Gentle Monster’s
D.Va-inspired eyewear. Blizzard also released teaser artwork for its Overwatch 2
Le Sserafim collab, which might offer a hint about future in-game skins:
